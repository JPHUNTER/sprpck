# sprpck
Atari Lynx sprite packer.

The sprite-packer built on 08/18/1998
SPRPCK supports BMP-files with 4 8 and 24-bit colours.

This version was forked from Wookie and I have updated it to execute properly on arch OSX 64bit.

Instructions:
git clone https://github.com/JPHUNTER/sprpck.git
cd sprpck
make
copy sprpck to your /usr/local/bin

sprpck away!
